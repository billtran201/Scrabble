Assignment: HW5 - Scrabble Game
Contact: theanh_tran@student.uml.edu



I successfully made the whole board the game Scrabble with all the correct bonus tiles (Triple and Double for both Words and Letters Bonuses). With the drag and drop feature,
even though the game score system doesn't work, I can drag a few tiles onto the board.



Extra Feature:

Board's Column and Row Name Toggle Button:
I made a toggle button for the board's tile row and column so if the player wish to hide or display them, they can toggle.
